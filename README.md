CSCO Installer - simple installer and updater for Counter-Strike: Classic Offensive.

All you have to do is run CS:CO Installer and click Download.

Steam installation folder is detected, but please check if it's correct.

Default directory is "C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam".


Before installation starts, Steam folder is verified if it exists and if it actually is a Steam folder. 


So you don't have to worry that you will install mod in wrong place.

After installation Steam will be automatically restarted.


Update process is as simple as installation. 

After you launch installer your CS:CO version is compared to version

on server and if newer is available, you can press Update button.


If you installed CS:CO but not by this installer after first launch there will be

a question if you have a latest version to create a local version file.


If you close the program when downloading is in progress all temporary files will be deleted.
